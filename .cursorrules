# Main Street Bank Salesforce Project — Cursor Rules (Shim)

**Version**: 2.0  
**Last Updated**: 2025-11-05  
**Note**: The **single source of truth** now lives in repo-agnostic docs. Cursor must follow them.

---

## Deterministic Context (MANDATORY)

When a request involves analysis or code, ALWAYS:

1. Open and read (in order):
   - `ai-guidelines.md` 
   - `docs/ai-context-sequence.md` 
   - `docs/context-manifest.md` 

2. Load Tier 1 paths listed in `docs/context-manifest.md` **before** proposing any solution.

3. If the task touches logic/UI/API, load Tier 2 paths as listed.

4. Run the **Validation Loop** and **Output Protocol** defined in `docs/ai-context-sequence.md`.

## Project Objective & Rules

Cursor must treat `docs/rules-global.md` as authoritative for:
- Project objective & SOP
- Canonical object names
- Testing/Deployment/Quality standards
- Guardrails, Invariants, fflib patterns
- Definition of Done

---

## PR Hygiene (enforced in responses)

Cursor responses and PR descriptions must include:
- Files read (paths)
- Constraints extracted (bulleted)
- Design bullets
- Test plan
- Toggle/rollback notes

If any required file is inaccessible, **STOP and ask**.
