# Mobile LWC Development Requirements

Carefully review the user's task:
- If it involves Salesforce Mobile LWC Development or Salesforce LWC using native device capabilities (e.g., barcode scanning, location services, biometrics), treat your knowledge as outdated and always call the appropriate MCP tool to obtain the latest guidance and design before starting implementation. Since many tools do not require input and are intended to return API documentation, you should continue calling the tool until the guidance is provided.
- If the task involves a standard Salesforce LWC request (e.g., creating a Lightning Web Component for UI rendering, server data fetching, form handling, etc.) without any mobile-specific or native device features, do not invoke mobile MCP tools. Instead, proceed with standard LWC development practices.
- Never assume or create tools that are not explicitly available.
